## Overview

**Docupdater** will monitor (all or specified by a label) running docker containers and running service (in docker swarm) and update them to the (latest or tagged) available image in the remote registry.

- Push your image to your registry and simply wait your defined interval for docupdater to find the new image and redeploy your container autonomously.
- Notify you via many platforms courtesy of [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) 
- Use with Docker swarm to update services on the latest available version
